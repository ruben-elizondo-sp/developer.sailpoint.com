    1. The current user is the Org Admin, in which case he or she may request a summary of all non-employee approval requests assigned to a particular account manager by passing in that manager's id.<br>
    2. The current user is an account manager, in which case "me" should be provided as the `requested-for` value. This will provide the user with a summary of the non-employee requests in the source(s) he or she manages.
