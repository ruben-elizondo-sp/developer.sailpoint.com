## What is a Filter

Many triggers can produce a staggering amount of events if left unfiltered,
resulting in more network traffic and more processing time on a subscribing
service. Your subscribing service usually only needs to be notified of events
containing a key attribute or value you want to process. For example, the
Identity Attributes Changed trigger emits an event whenever an identity has a
change in attributes. This can occur during the mover process when an identity
changes departments or a manager is promoted, resulting in several identities
receiving a new manager. Rather than inundate your subscribing service with
every identity change, you can use an event trigger filter to specify which
events your service is interested in processing.

## Benefits of Using Filters

Network bandwidth and processing power come at a cost, especially when you are
using managed solutions like AWS or no-code providers like Zapier. Without
filtering, a subscribing service would be sent every single event that the
trigger receives. The first thing any subscriber must do in this scenario is
inspect each event to figure out which ones it must process and which ones it
can ignore. Taking this approach with managed providers that charge per
invocation, like AWS Lambda, can become expensive. Furthermore, some no-code
providers may put a limit on the total number of invocations that a service can
make in a given month, which would be quickly exhausted with this approach.
Trigger filters take the filtering logic out of your subscribing service and
place it on the event trigger within SailPoint, so you only receive the events
matching your filter criteria.

## Constructing a Filter

Event Trigger Filters are constructed using a
[Jayway JSONPath expression (https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath)], which is Java port of [Goessner JSONpath expression](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).

*note: If working with workflows, only workflow triggers uses the advanced Jayway, all other workflow step json evaluatinos use Goessner, which doesnâ€™t support the full list of operators noted here, chiefly the "contains" filter.

### Expressions

JSONPath expressions specify a path to an element or array of elements in a JSON
structure. Expressions are used to select data in a JSON structure to check for
the existence of attributes or to narrow down the data where the filter logic is
applied.

| Expression        | Description                                                              | Example                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| $                 | **Root** - The root object / element.                                    | $                                         |
| @                 | **Current** - The current object / element of an array.                  | $.changes[?(@.attribute == "department")] |
| .                 | **Child operator** - Selects a child element of an object.               | $.identity                                |
| ..                | **Recursive descent** - JSONPath borrows this syntax from E4X.           | $..id                                     |
| \*                | **Wildcard** - All objects / elements regardless of their names.         | $.changes[*]                              |
| []                | **Subscript** - In Javascript and JSON, it is the native array operator. | $.changes[1].attribute                    |
| [,]               | **Union** - Selects elements of an array.                                | $.changes[0,1,2]                          |
| [start:stop:step] | **Array slice** - Selects elements of an array.                          | $.changes[0:2:1]                          |
| [:n]              | **Array slice** - Selects the first `n` elements of an array.            | $.changes[:2]                             |
| [-n:]             | **Array slice** - Selects the last `n` elements of an array.             | $.changes[-1:]                            |
| ?()               | **Filter expression** - Applies a filter expression.                     | $[?($.identity.name == "john.doe")]       |
| ()                | **Script expression** - Applies a script expression.                     | $.changes[(@.length-1)]                   |

### Operators

JSONPath operators provide more options to filter JSON structures.

| Operator | Description                                                                                                                    | Example                                                                             |

### Developing Filters

Developing a filter can be faster when you use a tool like an online
[JSONpath editor](https://jsonpath.herokuapp.com/). These tools can provide
quick feedback on your filter, allowing you to focus on the exact filter
expression you want before testing it in IdentityNow. Be aware, however, that
these online tools may have subtle differences compared with SailPoint's
implementation of Goessner JSONpath for non-trigger Workflows and Jayway JSONpath for triggers. Always test your JSONpath filter in
IdentityNow before using it in production.

Start by opening a [JSONpath editor](https://jsonpath.herokuapp.com/) in your
browser. Make sure that the correct implementation is selected if there is more
than one option. You can then paste in an example trigger input and start
crafting your JSONpath expression.

![JSONPath editor](./img/jsonpath-editor.png)

Most of the examples provided in the operator tables above can be used against
the Identity Attributes Changed event trigger input, as seen below. You can find
all of the input/output schemas for the other available triggers in our
[API specification](/idn/api/beta/triggers#available-event-triggers).

```json
{
  "identity": {
    "id": "ee769173319b41d19ccec6cea52f237b",
    "name": "john.doe",
    "type": "IDENTITY"
  },
  "changes": [
    {
      "attribute": "department",
      "oldValue": "Sales",
      "newValue": "Marketing"
    },
    {
      "attribute": "manager",
      "oldValue": {
        "id": "ee769173319b41d19ccec6c235423237b",
        "name": "robert.brown",
        "type": "IDENTITY"
      },
      "newValue": {
        "id": "ee769173319b41d19ccec6c235423236c",
        "name": "mary.johnson",
        "type": "IDENTITY"
      }
    },
    {
      "attribute": "cloudLifecycleState",
      "oldValue": "active",
      "newValue": "terminated"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Validating Filters

When you are finished developing your JSONpath filter, you must validate it with
SailPoint's trigger service. There are two ways to do this: use the UI or the
API.

### Validating Filters Using the UI

To validate a filter using the UI, subscribe to a new event trigger or edit an
existing one. In the configuration options, paste your JSONpath expression in
the `Filter` input box and select `Update`. If you do not receive an error
message, then your filter expression is valid with SailPoint.

![UI filter](./img/ui-filter.png)

### Validating Filters Using the API

You can validate a trigger filter by using the
[validate filter](/idn/api/beta/validate-filter) API endpoint. You must escape
any double quotes, as seen in the example payload in the API description. Also,
you must provide a sample input for the validation engine to run against. It is
best to use the input example included in the input/output schemas for the event
trigger you want to apply your filter to. Refer to
[this table](/idn/api/beta/triggers#available-event-triggers) to find the schema
of your event trigger. This is an example request:

```text
POST https://{tenant}.api.identitynow.com/beta/trigger-subscriptions/validate-filter
```

```json
{
  "input": {
    "identity": {
      "id": "ee769173319b41d19ccec6cea52f237b",
      "name": "john.doe",
      "type": "IDENTITY"
    },
    "changes": [
      {
        "attribute": "department",
        "oldValue": "Sales",
        "newValue": "Marketing"
      },
      {
        "attribute": "manager",
        "oldValue": {
          "id": "ee769173319b41d19ccec6c235423237b",
          "name": "robert.brown",
          "type": "IDENTITY"
        },
        "newValue": {
          "id": "ee769173319b41d19ccec6c235423236c",
          "name": "mary.johnson",
          "type": "IDENTITY"
        }
      },
      {
        "attribute": "cloudLifecycleState",
        "oldValue": "active",
        "newValue": "terminated"
      }
    ]
  },
  "filter": "$[?($.identity.name == \"john.doe\")]"
}
```

## Testing Filters

If SailPoint accepts your trigger filter, you must test whether it actually
works. You must configure your trigger subscription to point to the URL of your
testing service. [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) is an easy to use testing
service. Just copy the unique URL it generates and paste it into your
subscription's integration URL field. The easiest way to test a trigger
subscription is to use the UI to fire off a test event.

![test subscription](./img/test-subscription.png)

Once you fire off a test event, monitor your webhook.site webpage for an
incoming event. If the filter matches the test input, you will an event come in.
If the filter does not match the input, then it will nott fire. Test both
scenarios to make sure your filter is not always evaluating to `true`, and that
it will indeed evaluate to `false` under the correct circumstances. For example,
the filter `$[?($.identity.name contains "john")]` will match the test event for
Identity Attributes Changed and you will see an event in webhook.site, but you
also want to make sure that `$[?($.identity.name contains "archer")]` doesn't
fire because the test input is always the same.

If you want to control the test input to validate your filter against a more
robust set of data, use the
[test invocation](/idn/api/beta/start-test-invocation) API endpoint.
